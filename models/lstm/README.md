This folder contains code to train LSTM model for feature encoding for HCP data
LSTM_loader.py -> data loader to read in video features and fMRI data
LSTM_Net.py -> Deep learning architecture for our model
LSTM_main.py -> main training and testing file for the LSTM model

pretrained weights can be downloaded here: https://github.com/neurohackademy/feature-encoding/releases/tag/0.1

NOTE: fMRI data should be in 3mm voxels
